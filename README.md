Production: https://www.tricblueteam.com<br />
Version: 1<br /><br />

Version 2 Thoughts: This website needs to be brought to 2019. It's not scalable for blogposts or new pages. Use components (Angular, React, or Vue) to fix. One component for the header and one component for the footer. One component for the blog template. I won't get to it until August (if that). Feel free to tackle this issue. When picking a technology make sure there isn't a lot of overhead.
